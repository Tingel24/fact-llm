The best way to choose a random sample is to select a group that is representative of the entire student population. \n\nOption A suggests selecting ten students from each homeroom.

This group is not representative of the entire student body as it only includes students in the softball team. \n\nOption C is similar to B, focusing on the boys’ basketball team, which also limits the sample to a specific group. \n\nOption D suggests selecting students who like her favorite flavor of ice cream.
