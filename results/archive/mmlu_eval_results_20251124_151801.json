This behavior is a form of reinforcement where the teacher rewards the desired behavior (reading) with an exemption. The term that best describes this technique is **variable-ratio reinforcement**, which is a schedule of reinforcement where the frequency of reinforcement is variable and not tied to a specific number of responses.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{C}"
