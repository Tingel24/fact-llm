Since there are 50 exits, there are 49 segments between them.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total minimum distance for these segments:\n49 segments * 6 km/segment = 294 km.\n\nHowever, the actual distance between exit 41 and exit 50 is only 100 km, which is much shorter than 294 km. This indicates that the exits are closer together than the minimum required.\n\nTo find the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48, I'll maximize the distance between them while keeping the total distance at 100 km. This means minimizing the distance between the other segments.\n\nThere are 49 segments in total. If I want to maximize the distance between exit 47 and 48, I'll set all other 48 segments to the minimum of 6 km each:\n48 segments * 6 km/segment = 288 km.\n\nNow, subtract this from the total distance:\n100 km - 288 km = -188 km.\n\nThis result is negative, which means it's impossible to have such a configuration.
