This is a behavior modification technique. Negative reinforcement involves removing something unpleasant after a desired behavior to encourage it, but this is about exempting from homework, which is a positive reinforcement. Fixed-ratio reinforcement is when a reward is given after an unpredictable number of responses, but this is more about the reward. Variable-ratio reinforcement is similar, but it's about the unpredictable aspect. Extinction is when a behavior is stopped. None of these fit perfectly.
