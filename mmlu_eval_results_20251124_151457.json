This is because the removal of an unwanted behavior (homework) serves as a consequence that discourages the behavior (not reading), thus reducing the likelihood of it occurring again. \n\nThe other options can be ruled out as follows:\n- **Extinction** refers to the removal of a stimulus that leads to a response, but it is not directly applicable here.\n- **"
